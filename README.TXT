Q2: After we print out the ticket, the returned value is 0$


Q3: I do notice strange stuff on the machine's behaviour, even if I insert too much money
or a small amount of money, I can print out an infinite amount of tickets, even though
the minimal price I set was 350 cents.
I do not receive any refund, in fact, there isn't a mthod for a refund available.

Q5: No, there is no difference between the ticket from the new machine and the ticket
   from the old machine except for the minimal amount of money I have to insert
   which I customized myself.
